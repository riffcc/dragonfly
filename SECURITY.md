# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We are currently supporting the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Note, at this early stage of development, we may not backport patches to old minor versions.

In this case, to remain secure you will need to update to the latest version of Dragonfly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email security@dragonfly.computer with the details of the security issue or vulnerability.

We'll review it, tell you if our findings match yours,
and issue a patch or documentation to correct the issue.

### Responsible Disclosure
For critical issues, please avoid opening public issues or posts
that might risk exposing the security vulnerability prior to a patch being released.

Standard responsible disclosure rules apply.

For minor issues or concerns that you believe have small or no impact,
you may post them as issues in the Dragonfly issue tracker on GitHub.

We are committed to transparency - any issues disclosed will be publicly fixed or acknowledged once safe.

### Incident response
In the event of a major bug being reported and confirmed,
we will issue a notice to Dragonfly users and customers informing them
that a new version will be released at YYYY-MM-DD at time X (timezone GMT+ZZ)
and that it will contain critical security updates, advising all users to upgrade immediately.
