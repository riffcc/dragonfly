## What does it do?
Dragonfly is a virtual and bare-metal provisioning and orchestration system.
It answers the question:

> “I just racked a machine - what happens next?”

When a machine boots via PXE, it loads a minimal agent that registers itself with the Dragonfly server.

From there, Dragonfly can:

* Grab details about the machine
* Install an operating system
* Boot any ISO via the Dragonfly server
* Run memtest or drop to a root shell

Dragonfly turns unconfigured hardware into usable infrastructure —
automatically, securely, and *quickly*.

## Features
The main highlights:
- 🌍 Web interface for managing, deploying
  and monitoring your machines and infrastructure.
- 📡 Automatic machine registration via PXE + Spark (Dragonfly Agent)
- 🔄 Automated OS installation with support for ISOs, PXE, and chainloading.
- 🏎️ Deploy Linux in under 60 seconds.
- 🔧 Perform maintenance tasks such as memtest, rescue mode boot and remote reimaging.
More features:
- 🔒 Login system with admin/user roles and permissions
- 🔧 Reimage any machine in two clicks
- 🧠 Effortless grouping and tagging for your machines,
  and emoji/font-awesome icon support for easy visual identification.
- 💈 Real-time deployment tracking with progress bars and status indicators.
- 🏷️ "Just Type" experience — with bulk editing, drag-fill, and autocomplete.
- 🩻 Introspection - view details of your machines,
  including hardware, OS, and network configuration.
- 🔍 Search - find any machine by name, tag, or ID.

## 🤖 Interim AI Disclosure
This project's development is accelerated via contributions from LLMs ("code-gen"/"ai generated code").

A combination of manual human testing and automated testing is used when developing Dragonfly, and **real hardware with real stakes** is used to validate it.

Tools used include:
* Claude Code (Anthropic) + Codex (OpenAI) + Palace (Riff Labs)

Models used include:
* Claude (Anthropic, various models)
* GPT-Codex, GPT (OpenAI, various models)
* GLM (Z.ai, various models)

Further details on our specific usage of AI for development will be published in a documentation refresh.
